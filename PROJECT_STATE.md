## Current task

Task 9A: `CLOSED / PASS` at implementation commit
`6fec37c45346b1680fb0bf0676c38e515c18cacd` (`feat: implement Task 9A import
preflight`), parent `a742f56bb49e644ed062d78ec2de9505d47b593d`.
Task 8B remains `CLOSED / PASS`; Task 9A Task 1–2, the adaptation-model
checkpoint, and Restarted Task 3 are completed and committed. The final Task 9A
integration suite is 41/41 PASS with 0 failures, errors, or skips. No real
import, writer, V1.19 artifact, or promotion has started.

Current Task 3 execution state:

- Restarted Task 3: `COMPLETED`.
- C1: `PASS`.
- C2: `PASS`.
- C3: `PASS`.
- C4: `PASS`.
- C4 SIGNAL-SHAPE ALIGNMENT: `COMPLETED / PASS`.
- C5 classification layer: `COMPLETED / PASS`.
- C6: `COMPLETED / PASS`.

Scope:

- Task 8A's approved design and plan were implemented layer by layer with TDD and independent review checkpoints.
- The approved design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-task8a-pipeline-contracts-design.md`.
- The follow-up implementation plan is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-task8a-pipeline-contracts.md`.
- Audit: `COMPLETED`.
- Task 3A: `COMPLETED`.
- Database: `COMPLETED`.
- Export: `COMPLETED`.
- Release: `COMPLETED`.
- Task 8 completion evidence: `COMPLETED`.
- Maintained typed implementations now exist under `src/joy_m2/audit/`, `db/`, `export/`, and `release/`; no CLI or consumer migration was added.
- Task 8 completion authority is the maintained replay against approved protected/frozen references and compatibility contracts. Fresh legacy generation remains attribution evidence only.
- Completion evidence commit: `6969f3d88b00537386212bc91203c837cac58915`.
- Current branch is `task8b/pipeline-migration`; current committed HEAD is
  `6fec37c45346b1680fb0bf0676c38e515c18cacd`, parent
  `a742f56bb49e644ed062d78ec2de9505d47b593d`.
- V1.18 remains the current formal release. No formal database, frozen hash, compatibility object, question data, `data/`, `releases/`, or `legacy/` file changed.
- Task 8B unresolved blockers: `NONE`. Task 9A unresolved implementation
  blockers: `NONE`. Its exact sixteen-code issue pipeline includes
  `file_integrity_mismatch` as the sole package/file-level integrity issue; its
  field is `file_integrity`, its proposed candidate ID is `None`, and its exact
  evidence retains canonical relative path plus expected/actual SHA and size.
  It contributes no candidate count and blocks only through the unified
  issue/report/digest authority.
- Production contracts remain frozen; the actual V1.16 ZIP is not a maintained runtime input.
- Historical Task 8B post-commit clean-tree checkpoint: `PASS`; the Task 9A
  implementation commit passed its own post-commit clean-tree checkpoint.
- GitHub backup: `COMPLETE`; branch push and annotated tag push both completed.
- Tag: `joy-m2-task8b-closed-20260824`, targeting `6969f3d88b00537386212bc91203c837cac58915`.
- Pull request: not created.
- Task 8C: `NOT STARTED — PENDING EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION`.
- Task 9 design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-25-task9-batch-import-design.md`.
- Task 9A implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-25-task9a-import-contract-preflight.md`.
- Task 9 recovered scope is batch-import manifest and preflight first; no new questions, SQLite writes, formal version changes, CLI, App/API, worksheet generation, or promotion are authorized.
- Task 9A Task 1 immutable carriers: `RED→GREEN COMPLETED / COMMITTED`.
- Task 9A Task 2 typed manifest/inventory: `RED→GREEN COMPLETED / COMMITTED`.
- Task 9A Task 1–2 checkpoint commit: `dd1cfed2cf3d09caf9136d3c9e2cc8d487186221`; its history must not be rewritten.
- Task 9A Task 3 Stage 3A: `COMPLETED / GREEN`; its historical
  immediate-`NotImplementedError` scaffold and signature-only test have since
  evolved through approved dependency groups C1–C4. The historical C4
  checkpoint asset SHAs were `preflight.py`
  (`610e144a808bf88b69dcf3cc9e1f1d8d153a477fbae9eee274d1e1c5786abb33`) and
  `test_ingest_preflight.py`
  (`0fb7401c4a8b5b3a9fc1b9a07d2936a37e97f47b0045617f7ca5be4b2a029720`).
  The historical C5 production asset is recorded below.
- Task 9A Task 3 dependency-aware behavior: C1–C6 `COMPLETED / PASS`.
  Historical C4 and file-integrity signal-alignment checkpoints remain recorded
  in the Design and Plan as completed RED-first audit evidence. The committed
  production asset is `src/joy_m2/ingest/preflight.py`, SHA-256
  `c1df58017a08c66173648f82f287d625f2208d371981aa01ae09d75199d9bebd`;
  the committed integration test is
  `tests/integration/test_ingest_preflight.py`, SHA-256
  `5e5f01271dbbe67ad8b0119781af223d9c1d29a68254eecf0689520c8c83975b`.
- `src/joy_m2/ingest/__init__.py`: `NOT CREATED`; it is not a Stage 3A asset and remains deferred to its approved later task.
- Task 3 authority preserves all approved manifest/normalization/digest, adaptation/issue, image-identity, duplicate/rejected, and missing-image rules. The completed remediation left the existing seven duplicate/collision and eight non-duplicate codes unchanged and added exactly one package/file-level code, yielding a closed sixteen-code authority. A safely read file with a size/SHA mismatch emits `file_integrity_mismatch`; missing, unreadable, non-regular, and containment failures remain early `PipelineError`. Corrupted bytes are excluded from downstream parsing/evidence/matching, affected candidates are not constructed, and no second integrity channel or thirteenth digest key is allowed.
- The independent 37-method / 29-RED blocker scan found no other structured-BLOCKED condition lacking an approved `ImportIssue` code. That result preserves the closed sixteen-code inventory and does not authorize a seventeenth code.
- Historical audit sequence only, with no current execution effect: the earlier
  37-test RED state advanced to a 39-test mixed RED checkpoint after the C6
  stop-type boundary repair (39 collected, 8 PASS methods, 31 RED methods, 60
  failure instances, 0 ERROR, 0 skip), then to 39/39 PASS after C6 final
  closure. Final independent review identified the `missing_images` ordering
  and duplicate-ID occurrence-ambiguity gaps; two regression tests
  expanded the suite to its current final 41/41 PASS. All intermediate
  checkpoints are `HISTORICAL / CLOSED` audit evidence and must not be replayed.
- Task 9A exact target identity remains V1.19, while frozen V1.18 remains the read-only 497-question baseline.
- Task 9B: `NOT STARTED`; its intended responsibility is a Mathpix
  MMD/MMD.ZIP-to-canonical-Task-9-JSON/package adapter, not a writer. Direct PDF
  remains deferred. Task 9B executable authority is `NOT YET CLOSED`; its
  planning must separately freeze exact API/file scope, canonical adapter
  input/output, MMD question/sub-question and answer mapping, image/provenance
  mapping, ZIP traversal/absolute-path/symlink/duplicate-member/nested-archive
  policy, deterministic member ordering, malformed/unsupported-input taxonomy,
  fixture strategy, TDD sequence, and exit gate.
- Task 9C: `NOT STARTED`; V1.19 database/manifest serialization, writer, image destination, schema policy, and rollback authority remain deferred.
- Task 9D: `NOT STARTED`; no real batch acceptance has begun.
- `teacher_notes` and `common_errors` are Task 9A hashed import evidence/enrichment metadata, not current V2 formal fields; future formal representation requires separate schema authority.
- Task 9A images are read-only deterministic evidence only; no copy, move, rename, destination, or formal image identity change is authorized.
- Import approval binds `(batch_id, preflight_sha256, V1.19)` and is strictly separate from formal release/promotion authorization.
- Task 9 authority continues to freeze path-independent preflight digests,
  explicit translation/explanation provenance, and manifest-declared candidate
  ordering. The completed implementation makes the manifest digest,
  normalized-text digest, duplicate/collision issue taxonomy, and independent
  literal oracle fully reproducible without inspecting production projection
  code.
- The literal happy-path oracle remains unchanged: `manifest_sha256` is `b5a0ae6597028c48c6f7cdc81bd7e67d61dd369cbf96d7c6a4e96efd73984c5d` and final `preflight_sha256` is `087574a8af6fe28ac65a5b5810794952044cb5f0778ed3492d1e7819a4be33c2`.
- Formal database remains V1.18 with 497 questions; no new questions have been imported, no V1.19 artifact exists, no writer is authorized, and no promotion is authorized.
- Task 9A capability closure includes canonical JSON import preflight,
  deterministic and path-independent processing, read-only baseline access,
  exact sixteen-code structured issues, duplicate/collision/adaptation and
  file-integrity classification, candidate/package blocker separation, count
  closure, READY/BLOCKED status, deterministic ordering, exact final digest,
  the frozen literal oracle, and zero-write verification.
- Final independent implementation review: `PASS`. Remediation findings: two
  IMPORTANT found, two IMPORTANT remediated; final remediation review: `PASS`.
- Safety branch `backup/task-7.1-ceb179e-20260808` remains retained.

## Completion gate

- Explicit complete maintained suite: 195/195 passed, including Task 8 completion 3/3; skip=0 and expectedFailure=0.
- Task 8 equivalence: 3/3 passed.
- Task 7 structure and frozen-baseline tests: 7/7 passed.
- V1.18 independent verifier: `PASS` with 497/452/45 counts, integrity `ok`, and 0 foreign-key errors.
- Task 3–6 executable regressions: 13 + 9 + 10 + 22 = 54/54 passed.
- Task 6 oracle: 22/22 passed.
- Release focused tests: 48/48; Public Models: 66/66; Models + Config: 80/80; Audit: 21/21; Task 3A: 6/6; Database: 14/14; Export: 22/22; Export + Database: 36/36.
- Legacy attribution remains the approved 9 PASS / 2 FAIL surface: deterministic SQLite hash attribution and frozen artifact byte-equivalence attribution, with no third failure.
- Task 8B verification record: `docs/reports/TASK8B_VERIFICATION.md`.
- Task 8B implementation and completion evidence are fully closed; no next implementation stage is authorized.
- Task 9A integration: 41/41 PASS; Models/Manifest: 14/14 PASS; Public Models:
  66/66 PASS; Task 7: 7/7 PASS; Task 8 equivalence: 3/3 PASS; Release:
  48/48 PASS; V1.18 independent validator: `PASS`.
- Task 9A implementation is `CLOSED / PASS`; current remaining Task 9A
  implementation work: `NONE`. Its authority closure, RED gates, C1–C6,
  file-integrity migration and signal alignment, final independent review,
  remediation review, 41/41 GREEN, and implementation commit are completed.
- Task 8A final acceptance record remains `docs/reports/TASK8A_FINAL_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- Verification record: `docs/reports/TASK7_VERIFICATION.md`.
- Remote backup branch remains retained; no cleanup has been performed.

## Next task

Close Task 9B planning/authority before implementation. The next separately
authorized work may define the adapter contract and TDD plan for Mathpix
MMD/MMD.ZIP to canonical Task 9 JSON/package input. It must close the authority
gaps listed above and preserve Task 9A as the deterministic read-only preflight.
Task 9B implementation remains `NOT STARTED`; do not create an adapter until its
executable authority passes independent review. Do not start Task 8C, Phase 2A,
CLI/consumer migration, Task 9C/9D, a real import, SQLite mutation, writer, or
formal promotion.
